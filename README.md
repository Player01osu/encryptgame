# Encrype Game

## What is this?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a game that I have designed for my engineering 3 engineering fair. The objective of this game is to input the input card into the program, and with the output, match with the correct answer card.

## How is it made?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Designed the chassis in onshape, running the program on a pi, using the guts of an old keyboard for the input device, and some random screen to display everything.

## How to use?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compile game.c with the -lm flag
